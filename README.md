Fiber Landing Page using codewell.cc design template.

This project reinforced my layout skills and improved my css code quality as this was my first 2 page design layout.

It took me 3 attempts to finish this project as I kept restarting it as I learned how to make the code cleaner and more minimal.

I used SASS to keep my complied css clean and easy to read.
